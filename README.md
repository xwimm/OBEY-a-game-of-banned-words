# OBEY-a-game-of-banned-words
Introduction
 This project is an interactive artwork that uses hand-tracking and motion to “erase” a list of politically banned words taken from the Trump administration’s language restrictions. As the viewer moves their hand over the screen, each censored word turns MAGA red, disappears, and triggers the audio command “OBEY.” The work turns authoritarian language control into a satirical game, asking the participant to literally comply in the act of erasure. What begins as a playful interaction quickly exposes the absurdity and danger of ideological censorship.

How to 'play'. Run the code. Press "start" to start the camera. Use your hands to make the "woke" words disappear.
